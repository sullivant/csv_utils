## csv_utils

A small utility to display some metadata about the fields available in a "csv" (or otherwise delimited) data file.  This came about because I got tired of trying to determine the field lengths in a source data file that was very large and also wanted to learn some Rust.


### TODO
- [X] Use the crate "clap" as a way to pass CLI parameters
- [ ] Allow for any single char passed as parameter
